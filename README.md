Then, For The Home Page, we all have worked on something similar, so I would add the home page I built earlier as the index.html, so you all don't have to worry about that.

I have created a new repository on GitHub and have already added all of you. So please check your Email and join the group on GitHub so you all can start working. Thankyou.
